  ## Description
  Tasked with refactoring starter code to create the backend for an ecommerce store. This application has and accepts new categories, products, and tags for products which can be viewed and updated through api routes. The motivation to create this application was to better understand databases and how they could relate to application with complex databases such as an ecommerce store.  Through building this application I learned how to establish Many-to-Many relationships and explored how a Super Many-to-Many relationships could apply in future development
